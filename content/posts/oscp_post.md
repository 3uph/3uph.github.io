I’m happy to say that I finally earned the OSCP certification. It was not an easy achievement for me. I spent a lot of evenings and weekends learning, making mistakes, and trying again. This post is not a “look at me” story. It’s a honest guide about what helped me, what slowed me down, and what I would if i would have to do it again.
## Background
I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student on an Erasmus scholarship in Helsinki, Finland. When I first heard about the OSCP, it sounded like a dream and an impossible achievement for me. Everyone said it was the “must-have” certification for pentesting and Ethical hacking. At the start of my studies on this field, I did not believe I would ever write this post but I finally did it. I earned the OSCP.

Before OSCP, I passed the **eJPT** from INE/eLearnSecurity. That was a great first step. It taught me the basics: networking, simple enumeration, and a clean way to think about attacks. After that, I began learning with **S4vitar’s courses on Hack4U**. Those lessons helped me build good habits and a practical workflow.

Studying in Helsinki also helped me focus. I used my free time to practice labs, take notes, and build small scripts. I made many mistakes, but I kept going. Slowly, the OSCP stopped feeling “impossible” and started feeling like a big challenge I could plan for. This post shares exactly how I prepared, the tools and checklists I used, and what I would change next time.
