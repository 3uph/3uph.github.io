## How it started

For a long time, the word “hacker” felt like the movies, people typing all night and breaking anything they want. When I was a kid, I spent a lot of time on the internet: reading forums, watching YouTube, and playing video games. I saw many game hacks and felt curious. How do they do that? Are they breaking the game? Why doesn’t the company stop them? I asked myself these questions, but I never found a good answer.

## Why security pulled me in

Later, I decided to study Computer Engineering. That’s when things started to make sense. I began to understand how computers work, how software is built, and what’s really happening inside the systems I used every day.

At first, I got lost in the huge world of computers. I tried the software path: small desktop apps like a calculator, and a few web pages. But I didn’t feel fulfilled. I kept asking myself: _Why am I writing this code? Can someone break it? What happens if a user types something strange into this field?_ Those questions pushed me toward security. I started searching for security concepts and best practices.

One day on YouTube, I found **S4vitar**, a well-known cybersecurity creator in Spain. Around that time, he launched a cybersecurity academy called **Hack4U**. It looked very interesting, and that’s where my real journey into security began. After that first spark of curiosity, I started learning in a more serious way.

## Building basics

Nowadays I’m a 21 year old 4th-year Computer Engineering student on an Erasmus scholarship in Helsinki, Finland. My first step was taking the security courses at the Hack4U academy. That built my basics and helped me understand what it really means to be a pentester and why it is necessary. It still seemed like a really difficult path because there is no single path to follow. There is a lot of information, and you have to build your own journey. That scared me, but I continued anyway. After getting those certificates and feeling a bit confident, I moved to INE eLearnSecurity to try to achieve the eJPTv2, a certification that people say is a good start in this field. And that’s it, I purchased the course and the exam, and in a few months I got it. That felt really good. That felt like a start.

## Choosing OSCP

After this step, I began my LinkedIn research and made some friends in the field. I started looking at positions and what they asked for. I looked at LinkedIn profiles of people successful in the field, and they had something in common: most had the OSCP certification. I started my research and got discouraged because of the price. Why is it that expensive? Even now I still don’t know, but I can imagine. I decided to study on my own in the HTB Academy, where I almost finished the Pentester path. It was a really tough but rewarding study that pushed me every day. I thought about taking CPTS, but the OSCP was always in my mind.

One day in November 2024, I saw that OffSec Learn One was on discount, including OSWP and two attempts at the OSCP. Those two attempts were a game changer because they calmed my self-doubt. I had the confidence that if I failed one exam, I could still try again without spending that huge amount of money. And that was the day I started my OSCP journey.

## Attempt 1 and lessons

I started very motivated and pushed hard through the PEN-200 theory, almost finishing it in a couple of months while also studying at the university. Sometimes it was tough, because mixing OffSec’s course with my university work was really difficult. My first decision was to use my first attempt in the summer, so I could finish my university exams and have plenty of time to study. And that’s what I did. I finished the university year and started to prepare seriously. I did some Proving Grounds and HTB boxes from Lainkusanagi’s list, at least 30–40, but I looked at a lot of walkthroughs. To be honest, I didn’t feel prepared at all, but I thought that during the exam I could handle it. Spoiler: I failed. I got 40 points. It felt really bad, because in August I was going to start my scholarship in Helsinki, and I had the pressure of preparing for the exam in just 2–3 months before my attempt expired. Being in another country didn’t feel like the best situation for me.

## Reset in Helsinki

This is where things changed. When I arrived in Helsinki, I started to experience new things. It was my first time so far from my comfort zone. Everything I knew was different here, and that forced me to adapt. I built a routine: doing class assignments, studying, running, and cooking good meals. That felt really good. I also had the OSWP to do, and I was very focused, so I went through the course and took the exam in just two weeks. That was amazing for me. It taught me that with discipline and self-study, everything is possible, and it boosted my self-confidence.

## The grind and burnout

I started doing machines every day, hitting 5, 6, or even 7 a day. It was a hard push, but it built momentum and confidence. My exam was scheduled for the first week of November, and I went back to Spain because I wanted to take it on my desktop PC, not in my laptop. Two weeks before the exam, I felt burned out. I wasn’t as focused as at the start. By then, I had done about 80–90 machines. Because I wasn’t fully focused, I couldn’t root some boxes, and I began to doubt whether I could pass. My self-confidence went down. Reading Reddit threads about the exam and other people’s experiences didn’t help, I compared their backgrounds to mine and felt smaller. Spending a lot of time on LinkedIn didn’t help either. Seeing people earn big certs, land great jobs, and learn very hard things slowly discouraged me.

## The decision to rest

And here came the decision I think helped me pass the OSCP. After all these episodes of self-doubt, one day I told myself: _Arnau, you’ve worked a lot and you have a lot of practice. If you keep feeling like this, you won’t pass. Take these two weeks off, enjoy the experience here, and then go to Spain and crush the exam._ And that’s what I did. I spent two weeks hanging out with my new international friends and learning many different things.

## Exam day and result

I flew to Spain and prepared everything for the exam: my scripts, my tools, and all the files I had on my laptop. In the first two hours, I fully pwned the AD and got the first 40 points. A few hours later, I rooted another standalone box and reached 60. About an hour after that, I got a user flag on another machine, so I had 70 points. From there, I wasn’t focused on getting 100. I focused on writing a strong report instead of chasing more flags. I spent most of the remaining time redoing the chains that gave me those flags and taking clean screenshots and notes. Then I wrote the report and submitted it. A few days later, I got the email: I earned the OSCP certification. That email brought me relief, happiness, and peace. I achieved something I once thought I could never do. I became one of those people I used to see on LinkedIn. I overcame my self-doubt.

## My advice

For anyone aiming for the certification, here’s my advice: **don’t overthink it.** Doing machines is the best practice. The more you do, the more confident you feel. It’s not really about the number, to be honest. It’s about finding a **methodology that fits you**, the commands you like, the way you read a box, and how you choose your next move. Doing many machines helps you develop that feeling, but the “right number” is not the same for everyone. We’re all different. Keep pushing, learn from each attempt, and you will see results.

## What OSCP changed for me

I strongly believe the OSCP was not just a knowledge check for me, it changed my mindset and how I see myself. I learned that the most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you really want. Comparing yourself to others is not helpful. We are all different, with different backgrounds and soft skills. There are no two people the same. Stay in the present and build your future step by step.

Take ideas from other people’s paths, of course, but don’t let them discourage you. If you’re looking at your future and thinking about your goals, that is something to be proud of, not a reason to feel smaller. The people you admire were once like you. Use their stories as encouragement, not discouragement. If you work for something, a lot becomes possible. We are capable of more than we think.
